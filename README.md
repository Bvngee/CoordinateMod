# CoordinateMod

A simple client-side mod that helps you remember specific coordinates, and helps you find the corresponding coordinates in other dimensions. 
It allows you to "save" coordinates, and they will be stored as .txt files in a directory called "coordinates" that will be created in your .minecraft folder. 
It will also show you your current coordinates and the corresponding coordinates in other dimensions. 
The text files can be viewed and edited, and have 3 seperate lines for x, y, and z. 
To open the main Gui, press the "R" key, or another manually bound key in the controls.
